**Creating a Color Permutation Strategy for the ARC Corpus**

---

**Introduction**

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a dataset designed to evaluate artificial intelligence systems on tasks requiring abstraction and reasoning. Each ARC task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid using a finite set of color values, represented by integers from 0 to 9. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that:

- Creates a unique mapping (permutation) of colors for each task.
- Maintains the **relative relationships** between colors, regardless of their individual values.
- Reflects the conceptual behavior of **spinors**, which exhibit unique rotational properties.

---

**Understanding the Problem**

- **Colors**: Represented by integers 0 through 9.
- **Tasks**: Each task uses a subset of these colors.
- **Relative Relationships**: The way colors relate to each other in terms of frequency, spatial arrangement, or functional role within a task.
- **Spinors Analogy**: Spinors require a full 720-degree rotation to return to their original state, displaying unique transformation properties.

**Algorithm Overview**

1. **Identify Colors in the Task**: Extract the set of colors used in the current task.
2. **Determine Relative Relationships**: Assign values based on a chosen metric that captures the colors' relationships.
3. **Assign Indices to Colors**: Create an ordered list or structure that reflects the colors' relationships.
4. **Define the Mapping Function**: Develop a function that maps old colors to new colors while preserving relationships.
5. **Apply the Mapping**: Transform the original colors in the task using the mapping function.

**Step-by-Step Algorithm**

### **1. Identify Colors in the Task**

Let’s denote the set of colors used in the task as:

\[ C = \{ c_1, c_2, ..., c_n \} \]

- Example: \( C = \{ 2, 5, 7 \} \)

### **2. Determine Relative Relationships**

Choose a metric to evaluate the relationships between colors. Possible metrics include:

- **Frequency**: Number of times each color appears.
- **Spatial Position**: Average coordinates of the color's occurrence.
- **Interaction**: How colors interact or are adjacent to others.

**Example Using Frequency:**

Suppose we have the following frequencies:

- Color 2: 15 occurrences
- Color 5: 10 occurrences
- Color 7: 5 occurrences

### **3. Assign Indices to Colors**

Order the colors based on the chosen metric.

- **Ordered List Based on Frequency**:

  1. Color 2 (most frequent) – Index 0
  2. Color 5 – Index 1
  3. Color 7 (least frequent) – Index 2

### **4. Define the Mapping Function**

We need a function that:

- **Is a permutation**: Each input maps to a unique output.
- **Preserves relationships**: Maintains ordering or relative distances.
- **Is independent of actual color values**.

**Spinor Analogy in Mapping:**

- **Rotation Concept**: Map colors in a way that mimics rotation in a space, similar to how spinors behave.
- **Modulo Operation**: Use modulo arithmetic to create cyclical behavior.

**Mapping Function \( f(i) \):**

\[ f(i) = (i \times k) \mod 10 \]

- **\( i \)**: Index assigned to the color.
- **\( k \)**: A constant co-prime with 10 (to ensure a full permutation).
- **Modulo 10**: Wraps around the color values (0-9).

**Choosing \( k \):**

- Since 10 is the modulus, choose \( k \) such that \( \gcd(k, 10) = 1 \).
- Let's pick \( k = 3 \) (since \( \gcd(3, 10) = 1 \)).

**Apply Function to Indices:**

- **Index 0**: \( f(0) = (0 \times 3) \mod 10 = 0 \)
- **Index 1**: \( f(1) = (1 \times 3) \mod 10 = 3 \)
- **Index 2**: \( f(2) = (2 \times 3) \mod 10 = 6 \)

### **5. Apply the Mapping**

- **Color 2** (Index 0) maps to **0**.
- **Color 5** (Index 1) maps to **3**.
- **Color 7** (Index 2) maps to **6**.

**Resulting Mapping:**

\[ \text{Original Color} \rightarrow \text{New Color} \]
\[ 2 \rightarrow 0 \]
\[ 5 \rightarrow 3 \]
\[ 7 \rightarrow 6 \]

---

**Properties of the Algorithm**

- **Unique Mapping**: Each color maps to a distinct new color.
- **Relative Relationships Preserved**: The ordering based on frequency is maintained in the new color assignments.
- **Independent of Color Values**: The mapping depends on indices, not the original color values.
- **Spinor Analogy**: The modulo operation and use of a co-prime constant \( k \) simulate rotation and cyclical behavior akin to spinors.

**Generalized Algorithm Implementation**

```python
def create_color_mapping(colors_in_task, metric_func):
    # Step 1: Identify Colors
    colors = list(colors_in_task)
    n = len(colors)
    
    # Step 2: Determine Relative Relationships
    # Apply the metric function to obtain a value for each color
    metric_values = {color: metric_func(color) for color in colors}
    
    # Sort colors based on metric values (e.g., descending frequency)
    sorted_colors = sorted(colors, key=lambda c: -metric_values[c])
    
    # Step 3: Assign Indices
    color_indices = {color: index for index, color in enumerate(sorted_colors)}
    
    # Step 4: Define the Mapping Function
    k = select_coprime(10)  # Function to select a co-prime number with 10
    mapping_function = lambda i: (i * k) % 10
    
    # Step 5: Apply the Mapping
    color_mapping = {color: mapping_function(index) for color, index in color_indices.items()}
    
    return color_mapping

def select_coprime(modulus):
    # Returns a co-prime number with the given modulus
    for num in range(2, modulus):
        if gcd(num, modulus) == 1:
            return num
    return 1  # Fallback to 1 if no co-prime found

def gcd(a, b):
    # Compute the greatest common divisor
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Example metric function based on frequency
def frequency_metric(color):
    return color_frequency.get(color, 0)

# Assuming color_frequency is a predefined dictionary with color frequencies
color_frequency = {
    2: 15,
    5: 10,
    7: 5,
    # Add other colors if necessary
}

# Execute the algorithm
colors_in_task = {2, 5, 7}
color_mapping = create_color_mapping(colors_in_task, frequency_metric)

print(color_mapping)
# Output: {2: 0, 5: 3, 7: 6}
```

**Key Considerations**

- **Choice of Metric**: The metric function can be adjusted based on task requirements (frequency, spatial data, etc.).
- **Selection of \( k \)**: Choosing a co-prime with 10 ensures a full permutation without repeats.
- **Modulo Operation**: Reflects cyclical rotation, maintaining the spinor analogy.
- **Flexibility**: The algorithm can adapt to different tasks by changing the metric or mapping function.

---

**Conclusion**

This color permutation strategy provides a systematic way to map colors in ARC tasks while preserving their relative relationships. By simulating the rotational properties of spinors through the modulo operation and careful selection of mapping parameters, we achieve a unique and consistent mapping applicable across different tasks. The approach is both mathematically sound and conceptually aligned with the properties of spinors, offering an innovative solution to the problem.
